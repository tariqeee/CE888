Stress Detection Project
This project is focused on detecting stress using machine learning by analyzing physiological indicators, such as heart rate and skin conductance. The aim is to create an accurate and efficient model for predicting stress. To use this project, please follow the steps outlined below.

Step 1
Download the complete project repository file and extract it. The zip file contains several files, including:

Main.tex: The LaTeX file used to generate the PDF report.
Image folder: Contains all images and result outputs for the project.
content folder: Holds the stress detection dataset provided by M.S. Ravi's 2021 GitHub repository, Stress-Detection-in-Nurses https://github.com/CPHSLab/Stress-Detection-in-Nurses.
output.log: Lists the output of all LaTeX documents.
reference.bib: Contains all references used to create the report document.
stress_detection.ipynb: The main source code file.
README and LICENSE files.

Step 2
Open the stress_detection.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. Be sure to install all necessary libraries by executing the following command in your Jupyter Notebook:

!pip install library_name

Replace 'library_name' with the specific library needed for the project. This may need to be done for multiple libraries.

Additionally, verify the dataset location/path is accurate.

Step 3
Click the "Run All" button in Jupyter Notebook to see the output. Enjoy exploring the stress detection project!

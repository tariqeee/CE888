# Stress Detection Project

This project focuses on stress detection using machine learning, based on physiological features such as heart rate and skin conductance. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient stress prediction model. If you want to use this project, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1

Download the full project repository file and unzip it.

## Step 2

Open the `stress_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to install all the required libraries by running the following command in your Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
!pip install library_name

Replace library_name with the appropriate library required for the project. You may need to do this for multiple libraries.

Also, check the dataset location/path and make sure it is correct.

## Step 3
Now you can click the "Run All" button in Jupyter Notebook and see the output. Enjoy exploring the stress detection project!

# Lab 7: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This week we start working with neural networks. We will use CNNs to classify images by creating and training two different network architectures.

Open the notebook cnn.ipynb in Colab and follow the instructions. Once you've finished, open the lab quiz on Moodle to verify your answers.
